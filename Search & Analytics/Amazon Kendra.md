Amazon Kendra is an intelligent search service powered by machine learning. Kendra reimagines enterprise search for your websites and applications so your employees and customers can easily find the content they are looking for, even when it’s scattered across multiple locations and content repositories within your organization.

Using Amazon Kendra, you can stop searching through troves of unstructured data and discover the right answers to your questions, when you need them. Amazon Kendra is a fully managed service, so there are no servers to provision, and no machine learning models to build, train, or deploy. Amazon Kendra supports unstructured and semi-structured data in .html, MS Office (.doc, .ppt), PDF, and text formats.

Unlike conventional search technology, natural language search capabilities return the answers you’re looking for quickly and accurately, no matter where the information lives within your organization.

Amazon Kendra’s deep learning models come pre-trained across 14 industry domains, allowing it to extract more accurate answers across a wide range of business use cases from the get-go. You can also fine-tune search results by manually adjusting the importance of data sources, authors, freshness, or using custom tags.
