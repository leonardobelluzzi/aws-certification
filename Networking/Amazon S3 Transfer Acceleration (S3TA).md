Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (S3TA) enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and your [Amazon S3](../Services/Technology/Storage/S3.md) bucket. S3 Transfer Acceleration leverages [Amazon CloudFront's](../Services/Amazon%20CloudFront.md) globally distributed AWS Edge Locations. As data arrives at an AWS Edge Location, data is routed to your Amazon S3 bucket over an optimized network path. S3 Transfer Acceleration is designed to optimize transfer speeds from across the world into S3 buckets. If you are uploading to a centralized bucket from geographically dispersed locations, or if you regularly transfer GBs or TBs of data across continents, you may save hours or days of data transfer time with S3 Transfer Acceleration.
