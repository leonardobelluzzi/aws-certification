AWS Business Support plan is the MOST cost-effective option for the given use-case.
### AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support

AWS Enterprise On-Ramp Support plan provides 24x7 phone, email and chat access to technical support however it's costlier than the AWS Business Support plan.

### AWS Developer Support

You should use the AWS Developer Support plan if you are testing or doing early development on AWS and want the ability to get email based technical support during business hours as well as general architectural guidance as you build and test. This plan does not support 24x7 phone based technical support.
