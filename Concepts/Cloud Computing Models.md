Cloud Computing can be broadly divided into three types - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS).
### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT. It typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS gives the highest level of flexibility and management control over IT resources. Examples - Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode.
### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

PaaS removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. You don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. Examples - Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft).
### Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. With a SaaS offering, you don’t have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed. You only need to think about how you will use that particular software. Examples - Amazon Rekognition, Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom.

## Computing Deployment Models

A hybrid deployment is a way to connect your on-premises infrastructure to the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems.

Overview of Cloud Computing Deployment Models: 



**Elasticity** - Instead, you provision the number of resources that you need. You can scale these resources up or down instantly to grow and shrink capacity as your business needs change.

**Reliability** - Refers to the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, by dynamically acquiring computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions.

**Durability** - Refers to the ability of a system to assure data is stored and data remains consistently on the system as long as it is not changed by legitimate access, i.e. data should not get corrupt or disappear from the cloud because of a system malfunction.

**Resiliency** - Describes the ability of a system to recover from a failure induced by the load (data or network), attacks, and failures (hardware, software, or network failures).
