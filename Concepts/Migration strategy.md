### **1. Initial Assessment**

- Analyze the current environment (applications, servers, databases, dependencies).
- Define business goals: cost reduction, scalability, modernization, etc.
- Use tools like **AWS Migration Evaluator** or **AWS Application Discovery Service**.

### **2. The 6 Migration Strategies (6 Rs)**

| Strategy       | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rehost**     | "Lift and Shift" – move applications to AWS with minimal or no changes. Example: migrate to EC2.  |
| **Replatform** | Make slight optimizations without changing the core architecture. Example: move databases to RDS. |
| **Repurchase** | Replace with a SaaS solution. Example: switch from custom CRM to Salesforce.                      |
| **Refactor**   | Redesign the application to leverage cloud-native features. Example: use AWS Lambda, DynamoDB.    |
| **Retire**     | Decommission applications that are no longer needed.                                              |
| **Retain**     | Keep some applications on-premises for now.                                                       |
