## USE CASE

**Warm Standby strategy**

When selecting your disaster recovery (DR) strategy, you must weigh the benefits of lower RTO (recovery time objective) and RPO (recovery point objective) vs the costs of implementing and operating a strategy. The pilot light and warm standby strategies both offer a good balance of benefits and cost.

## USE CASE

A cargo shipping company runs its server fleet on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. Some of these instances host the CRM (Customer Relationship Management) applications that need to be accessible 24*7. These applications are not mission-critical. In case of a disaster, these applications can be managed on a lesser number of instances for some time.

Which disaster recovery strategy is well-suited as well as cost-effective for this requirement?
