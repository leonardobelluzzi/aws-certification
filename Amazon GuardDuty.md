Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS account. Amazon GuardDuty analyzes billions of events across your AWS accounts from AWS CloudTrail (AWS user and API activity in your accounts), Amazon VPC Flow Logs (network traffic data), and DNS Logs (name query patterns). Security findings are retained and made available through the Amazon GuardDuty console and APIs for 90-days.
