AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software vendors that make it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS. The AWS Marketplace enables qualified partners to market and sell their software to AWS Customers.

AWS Marketplace offers two ways for sellers to deliver software to customers: Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and Software as a Service (SaaS).

Amazon Machine Image (AMI): Offering an AMI is the preferred option for listing products in AWS Marketplace. Partners have the option for free or paid products. Partners can offer paid products charged by the hour or month. Bring-Your-Own-License (BYOL) is also available and enables customers with existing software licenses to easily migrate to AWS.

Software as a Service (SaaS): If you offer a SaaS solution running on AWS (and are unable to build your product into an AMI) the SaaS listing offers our partners a way to market their software to customers.
