## Storage Classes

### Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
Is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. S3 Standard-IA offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance make S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.

### Amazon S3 Standard
The Amazon S3 Standard offers high durability, availability, and performance object storage for frequently accessed data. S3 standard would turn out to be costlier than S3 Standard-IA for the given use-case, so this option is not correct.

### Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)
The Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead. It works by storing objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. S3 Intelligent-Tiering would turn out to be costlier than S3 Standard-IA for the given use-case, so this option is not correct.

### Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier)
Amazon S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage class for data archiving and long-term backup. It is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability, and provide comprehensive security and compliance capabilities that can help meet even the most stringent regulatory requirements. S3 Glacier does not support rapid data retrieval, so this option is ruled out.

### Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) is for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other Amazon S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZ), Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) stores data in a single Availability Zone (AZ).

Please review this illustration for Amazon S3 Storage Classes availability. You don't need to memorize the actual numbers, just remember that Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) offers the lowest availability:

## Security and Encryption

All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default, and objects are automatically encrypted by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3). This encryption setting applies to all objects in your Amazon S3 buckets.

## USE CASE

A web application stores all of its data on Amazon S3 buckets. A client has mandated that data be encrypted before sending it to Amazon S3.

Which of the following is the right technique for encrypting data as needed by the customer?

Correct answer

Enable client-side encryption using AWS encryption SDK

Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
## USE CASE 

A company needs a storage solution for a project wherein the data is accessed less frequently but needs rapid access when required. Which S3 storage class is the MOST cost-effective for the given use-case?

### Amazon S3 Block Public Access
The Amazon S3 Block Public Access feature provides settings for access points, buckets, and accounts to help you manage public access to Amazon S3 resources. By default, new buckets, access points, and objects don't allow public access. However, users can modify bucket policies, access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access. S3 Block Public Access settings override these policies and permissions so that you can limit public access to these resources.

When Amazon S3 receives a request to access a bucket or an object, it determines whether the bucket or the bucket owner's account has a block public access setting applied. If the request was made through an access point, Amazon S3 also checks for block public access settings for the access point. If there is an existing block public access setting that prohibits the requested access, Amazon S3 rejects the request.

## Static Website Hosting

To host a static website on Amazon S3, you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. When you configure a bucket as a static website, you must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index document.

Hosting a static website on Amazon S3:

### Fix the Amazon S3 bucket policy
If you want to configure an existing bucket as a static website that has public access, you must edit block public access settings for that bucket. You may also have to edit your account-level block public access settings. Amazon S3 applies the most restrictive combination of the bucket-level and account-level block public access settings.

## Versioning

Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both unintended user actions and application failures.

Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite. For example: if you delete an object, instead of removing it permanently, Amazon S3 inserts a delete marker, which becomes the current object version.

## S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)

Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. You can copy objects between different AWS Regions or within the same Region.

Although Amazon S3 stores your data across multiple geographically distant Availability Zones by default, compliance requirements might dictate that you store data at even greater distances. S3 cross-region replication (S3 CRR) allows you to replicate data between distant AWS Regions to satisfy these requirements.

## VPC Gateway Endpoint Support

 **Amazon S3 is one of only TWO services that support VPC Gateway Endpoint**

-  [Amazon S3](S3.md)
-  [Amazon DynamoDB](Amazon%20DynamoDB.md)

**Benefits of using VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3:**
-  **No additional cost** (Gateway Endpoints are free)
-  **Private connectivity** - Traffic doesn't leave AWS network
-  **Better performance** - Lower latency
-  **Cost savings** - No NAT Gateway charges

**Note:** Amazon S3 also supports VPC Interface Endpoint (paid), but Gateway Endpoint is the preferred option for cost optimization.

For more details, see [VPC Endpoints](../VPC%20-.md).

## Pricing

There are four cost components to consider for S3 pricing  storage pricing; request and data retrieval pricing; data transfer and transfer acceleration pricing; and data management features pricing. Under "Data Transfer", You pay for all bandwidth into and out of Amazon S3, except for the following:
- (1) Data transferred in from the internet,
- (2) Data transferred out to an [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)](../../EC2.md) instance, when the instance is in the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket,
- (3) Data transferred out to [Amazon CloudFront](../../Amazon%20CloudFront.md).
