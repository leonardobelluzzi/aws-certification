Amazon EBS is an easy-to-use, high-performance, block-storage service designed for use with [Amazon EC2](../../EC2.md) instances. It is a block-storage service and not a file storage service.




Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy to use, high-performance block storage service designed for use with [Amazon EC2](../../EC2.md) for both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale.

Designed for mission-critical systems, EBS volumes are replicated within an Availability Zone (AZ) and can easily scale to petabytes of data. You can attach an available EBS volume to one instance that is in the same Availability Zone (AZ) as the volume.

You should note that a feature called Amazon EBS Multi-Attach enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) volume to multiple instances that are in the same Availability Zone. You can attach multiple Multi-Attach enabled volumes to an instance or set of instances. Each instance to which the volume is attached has full read and write permission to the shared volume. Multi-Attach makes it easier for you to achieve higher application availability in applications that manage concurrent write operations.


Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Snapshots are stored incrementally, which means you are billed only for the changed blocks stored
  
You will pay a fee each time you read from or write data stored on the Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) - Infrequent Access storage class

## USE CASE

EBS volume can be attached to a single instance in the same Availability Zone (AZ) whereas EFS file system can be mounted on instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZ)
