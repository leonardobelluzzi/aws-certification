**Read Replica improves database scalability**

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Read Replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. Read Replicas are used for improved read performance. You can also place your read replica in a different AWS Region closer to your users for better performance. Read Replicas are an example of horizontal scaling of resources.
