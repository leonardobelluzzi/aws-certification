Amazon Rekognition makes it easy to add image and video analysis to your applications. You just provide an image or video to the Amazon Rekognition API, and the service can identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities. It can detect any inappropriate content as well. Amazon Rekognition also provides highly accurate facial analysis and facial recognition. With Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can create a machine learning model that finds the objects, scenes, and concepts that are specific to your business needs.
