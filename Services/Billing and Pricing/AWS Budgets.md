AWS Budgets gives you the ability to set custom budgets that alert you when your costs or usage exceed (or are forecasted to exceed) your budgeted amount.

You can also use AWS Budgets to set reservation utilization or coverage targets and receive alerts when your utilization drops below the threshold you define. Reservation alerts are supported for Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache, and Amazon Elasticsearch reservations.

Help you receive alerts when the reservation utilization falls below the defined threshold.

**Cost budget** - Helps you plan how much you want to spend on a service.

**Usage budget** - Helps you plan how much you want to use one or more services.

**Reservation budget** - This helps you track the usage of your Reserved Instances (RI). Two ways of doing it - Reserved Instance (RI) utilization budgets (This lets you see if your Reserved Instances (RI) are unused or under-utilized), Reserved Instance (RI) coverage budgets (This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by a reservation).
