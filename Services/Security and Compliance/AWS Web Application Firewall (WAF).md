AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) gives you control over how traffic reaches your applications by enabling you to create security rules that block common attack patterns such as **SQL injection** or **cross-site scripting**. You can also use rate-based rules to mitigate the Web layer **DDoS attack**.
