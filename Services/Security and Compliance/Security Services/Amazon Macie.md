Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data in AWS. Macie automatically provides an inventory of [Amazon S3](Technology/Storage/S3.md) buckets including a list of unencrypted buckets, publicly accessible buckets, and buckets shared with AWS accounts outside those you have defined in [AWS Organizations](Billing%20and%20Pricing/AWS%20Organization.md).
