AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. AWS CloudTrail can be used to record AWS API calls and other activity for your AWS account and save the recorded information to log files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket that you choose. By default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your S3 bucket are encrypted using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

It has encryption enabled by default
