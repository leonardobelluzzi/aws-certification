AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). AWS Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications. AWS Fargate removes the need to provision and manage servers, lets you specify and pay for resources per application, and improves security through application isolation by design.
